# Project Proposal: Energy Consumption Prediction

## Problem Statement
Predicting energy consumption is vital for effective energy management, enabling energy-saving measures, and enhancing the efficiency of energy distribution systems. It supports the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, aligning energy supply with demand, and reducing reliance on non-renewable, environmentally harmful sources. Accurate forecasts can lead to cost savings for both energy producers and consumers through optimized production and consumption strategies.

## Solution
Machine Learning (ML) is well-suited for predicting energy consumption due to its ability to process large volumes of historical data and uncover complex, non-linear relationships. Techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, deep learning frameworks, and ensemble methods are used for capturing temporal dependencies and variability in time series patterns. ML models adapt to new data, improve with more input, and provide accurate predictions even with changing consumption behaviors or external factors like weather.

## Data
The primary dataset is the Individual Household Electric Power Consumption dataset, a multivariate time-series dataset recording power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over 3 years. Key variables include Date, Time, Global Active Power, Voltage, and sub-metering. The goal is to predict future values of energy consumption, enabling more efficient energy allocation.
